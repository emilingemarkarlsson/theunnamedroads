## The Difference: Studio vs Accelerator vs Fund

**Venture Studio**: Builds companies from scratch, owns significant equity, provides operational support.

**Accelerator**: Provides mentorship and funding to existing startups, takes smaller equity.

**Fund**: Provides capital only, takes equity, minimal operational involvement.

AI-native studios can operate with dramatically lower overhead, enabling solo operators to manage portfolios that previously required teams.
