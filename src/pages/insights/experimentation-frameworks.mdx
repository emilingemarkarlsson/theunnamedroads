# Rapid Experimentation Frameworks

**Pillar Page** | Part of our [AI-Native Venture Building](/insights) topical authority

This pillar provides actionable frameworks that readers can implement immediately, establishing this site as a practical resource for systematic business experimentation.

## Core Concept

Methodology is what separates systematic builders from random experimenters. This pillar covers structured approaches to testing business ideas quickly, making data-driven decisions, and avoiding the sunk cost fallacy.

## Key Topics Covered

### The 12-Week Framework
- Week-by-week breakdown of experiment phases
- Problem validation and market research
- MVP development and iteration
- Data analysis and decision-making
- Scale/pivot/kill criteria

### Experiment Design
- Hypothesis formation for business experiments
- Success metrics for rapid experiments
- Minimum viable test design
- Parallel experiment management
- Experiment portfolio optimization

### Decision Frameworks
- When to continue vs pivot vs kill
- Data requirements for decisions
- Learning extraction from failed experiments
- Transitioning from experiment to real business
