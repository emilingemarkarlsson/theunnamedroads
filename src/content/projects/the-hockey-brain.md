# The Hockey Brain Consulting

**Where modern data analytics tools meet the world of hockey.** The Hockey Brain is
a Stockholm-based consultancy that embeds senior-level analytics capabilities
inside pro teams without the overhead of full-time hires.

## Why It Exists

- **Discover hidden edges** with custom metrics that expose signal beyond traditional box scores.
- **Accelerate decisions** on drafts, lineups, and roster moves with predictive modeling.
- **Reduce uncertainty** using tactical simulations and scenario planning.
- **Scale development** by applying the same analytics framework across leagues and affiliates.

## How Engagements Work

1. **Assessment & Intake** – capture telemetry from existing scouting, video, and tracking systems.
2. **Custom Model Stack** – spin up AI copilots, dashboards, and reporting loops tuned to each organization.
3. **Embedded Analysts** – operate as an extension of the hockey ops group, delivering weekly briefings and live support during critical windows.
4. **Iterate & Scale** – expand to new surfaces (draft, player development, matchups) once the initial mandate is humming.

## Representative Deliverables

- Expected goals and finishing quality benchmarks for entire rosters.
- Tactical matchup boards that visualize forecheck, zone entry, and special teams trends.
- Draft and recruitment intelligence that scores upside vs. role fit through AI-assisted scouting reports.
- Dashboards and alerts that highlight when performance deviates from predictive models.

## Why Teams Plug In

- **Complement Your Team** – fill analytics gaps without re-org overhead.
- **Cost-Effective Expertise** – senior talent on-demand instead of permanent headcount.
- **On-Demand Scaling** – surge support during playoffs, trade deadlines, or draft prep, then scale down again.
