# The 12-Week Experiment Framework

After testing dozens of business ideas anonymously, we've developed a structured 12-week framework that maximizes learning while minimizing time investment. This methodology has become our core approach to business experimentation.

## Why 12 Weeks?

Traditional startup timelines are either too short (fail to gather meaningful data) or too long (risk sunk cost fallacy). We chose 12 weeks because:

- **Long enough** to build and test a meaningful MVP
- **Short enough** to maintain urgency and focus
- **Matches quarterly business cycles** for easy integration
- **Allows 4 experiments per year** for individual builders

## Framework Overview

### **Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-3)**

- Problem validation and market research
- Hypothesis formation and success metrics
- Initial prototype or concept validation

### **Phase 2: Development (Weeks 4-9)**

- MVP building and iteration
- User testing and feedback collection
- Market positioning and go-to-market testing

### **Phase 3: Evaluation (Weeks 10-12)**

- Data analysis and decision making
- Scale/pivot/kill determination
- Knowledge documentation and sharing

## Week-by-Week Breakdown

### **Week 1: Problem Definition**

**Objectives:**

- Clearly define the problem you're solving
- Identify target user segments
- Research existing solutions and their limitations

**Deliverables:**

- Problem statement (one paragraph)
- Target user personas (2-3 profiles)
- Competitive landscape analysis
- Initial hypothesis about solution approach

**AI Collaboration:**

```
Prompt: "Help me analyze this problem space: [description].
What angles haven't I considered? What adjacent problems exist?"
```

**Success Criteria:**

- Problem resonates with 5+ potential users
- Clear differentiation from existing solutions
- Quantifiable problem impact identified

### **Week 2: Market Validation**

**Objectives:**

- Validate problem importance with real users
- Understand willingness to pay for solutions
- Identify unexpected insights or pivots

**Activities:**

- 15-20 user interviews (anonymous when needed)
- Survey deployment to broader audience
- Social media/forum research for problem discussion

**Deliverables:**

- Interview summary with key insights
- Market size estimation
- Pricing sensitivity analysis
- Refined problem statement

**Decision Point:**
Continue if 70%+ of interviews confirm problem importance.

### **Week 3: Solution Hypothesis**

**Objectives:**

- Design initial solution approach
- Create testable hypotheses about user behavior
- Plan MVP feature set

**Deliverables:**

- Solution overview (mockups or wireframes)
- Core feature prioritization
- User journey mapping
- Technical feasibility assessment

**Key Questions:**

- What's the minimum viable test of our hypothesis?
- How will we measure success?
- What could kill this idea fastest?

### **Week 4-6: MVP Development**

**Objectives:**

- Build minimum testable version
- Focus on core value proposition only
- Prepare for user testing

**Development Principles:**

- **No-code first**: Use existing tools when possible
- **Manual processes**: Automate later, validate first
- **Ugly but functional**: Polish comes after validation

**Common MVP Approaches:**

- **Landing page + email signup** for demand testing
- **Wizard of Oz**: Manual backend with automated frontend
- **Concierge**: Completely manual service delivery
- **Prototype**: Interactive mockup for user testing

### **Week 7-9: Testing and Iteration**

**Objectives:**

- Get product in users' hands
- Collect quantitative and qualitative feedback
- Iterate based on real usage data

**Testing Framework:**

- **Week 7**: Initial user testing (5-10 users)
- **Week 8**: Broader release (50-100 users if possible)
- **Week 9**: Analysis and final iteration

**Metrics to Track:**

- **Engagement**: How often do users return?
- **Completion**: Do users finish core actions?
- **Satisfaction**: NPS or satisfaction scores
- **Conversion**: Do users take desired actions?

### **Week 10: Data Analysis**

**Objectives:**

- Synthesize all experiment data
- Identify key learnings and insights
- Prepare for decision making

**Analysis Framework:**

1. **Quantitative Review**: Usage data, conversion rates, engagement metrics
2. **Qualitative Synthesis**: User feedback themes and insights
3. **Market Response**: Demand signals and competitive reactions
4. **Technical Learnings**: Development insights and challenges

**AI Collaboration:**

```
Prompt: "Here's our experiment data: [summary]. What patterns do you see?
What are the strongest signals for/against continuing?"
```

### **Week 11: Decision Framework**

**Objectives:**

- Make clear continue/pivot/kill decision
- If continuing, plan scaling approach
- If stopping, extract maximum learning value

**Decision Matrix:**

| Criteria                 | Weight | Score (1-10) | Weighted Score |
| ------------------------ | ------ | ------------ | -------------- |
| Problem Validation       | 25%    |              |                |
| Market Demand            | 25%    |              |                |
| Solution Effectiveness   | 20%    |              |                |
| Technical Feasibility    | 15%    |              |                |
| Business Model Viability | 15%    |              |                |

**Score > 7.0**: Scale or continue development
**Score 5.0-7.0**: Pivot or extend experiment
**Score < 5.0**: Archive and document learnings

### **Week 12: Documentation and Transition**

**Objectives:**

- Document all learnings for future reference
- If scaling: create handoff plan
- If stopping: conduct post-mortem
- Share insights with community

**Knowledge Capture:**

- **Executive Summary**: One-page overview of experiment
- **Data Package**: All metrics, feedback, and analysis
- **Lessons Learned**: What worked, what didn't, what surprised us
- **Next Steps**: Recommendations for future work

## Getting Started

Ready to try the 12-week framework? Here's your starter checklist:

**Week 0 (Preparation):**

- [ ] Choose problem space to explore
- [ ] Set up anonymous communication channels
- [ ] Prepare research and development tools
- [ ] Define success criteria for experiment
- [ ] Schedule weekly review sessions (with AI partner)

**Week 1 Action Items:**

- [ ] Write one-paragraph problem statement
- [ ] List 10 people to interview about this problem
- [ ] Research 5 existing solutions

## Conclusion

The 12-week experiment framework provides structure without constraining creativity. It's long enough to build something meaningful but short enough to fail fast when needed.

The key is committing to the timeline and decision criteria upfront. This prevents the most common startup mistake: continuing failed ideas too long due to emotional attachment.

After running dozens of experiments through this framework, we've found it creates the perfect balance between thorough validation and rapid iteration—exactly what anonymous building requires.
