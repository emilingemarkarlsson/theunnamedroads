# What's the difference between reactive and proactive agents?

> **Part of our [Auto Agent Workflows](/insights/auto-agent-workflows) pillar** — This foundational concept is essential for understanding how to build autonomous agent systems.

The key difference is simple: **reactive agents wait for instructions, proactive agents generate work for you to approve**. This distinction is what enables true solo operator scaling—agents that don't just execute your commands, but think ahead and propose actions.

## Reactive Agents: The Traditional Approach

Reactive agents are the automation tools you're probably familiar with:

- **Triggered by events**: "When X happens, do Y"
- **Require explicit instructions**: You must define every workflow
- **Execute predefined actions**: They follow scripts, not reasoning
- **Examples**: Zapier workflows, IFTTT, scheduled scripts

Reactive agents are powerful, but they're limited to what you've already thought of. They're excellent for repetitive tasks, but they don't help you discover new opportunities or solve problems you haven't anticipated.

## Proactive Agents: The Game Changer

Proactive agents work differently:

- **Monitor and analyze**: They continuously watch your systems, data, and market
- **Generate proposals**: They identify opportunities and suggest actions
- **Request approval**: You review their suggestions and approve or modify
- **Execute after approval**: Once approved, they execute autonomously

This is the difference between automation and true AI collaboration. Proactive agents become your **thinking partners**, not just execution tools.

## Real-World Example: Signal Mesh

In our [Post-Human Venture Engine](/projects/post-human-venture-engine), we use proactive agents in what we call the "Signal Mesh":

**Reactive approach**: "Alert me when someone mentions our product on Twitter"
**Proactive approach**: "Monitor cultural, capital, and technology shifts, identify asymmetric opportunities, and propose experiments to test"

The proactive agent doesn't just notify—it analyzes patterns, connects dots across multiple data sources, and proposes concrete next steps.

## When to Use Each

### Use Reactive Agents For:
- Repetitive, well-defined tasks
- Data synchronization
- Scheduled operations
- Simple if-then logic
- Tasks where you know exactly what needs to happen

### Use Proactive Agents For:
- Opportunity discovery
- Strategic analysis
- Problem identification
- Market research
- Tasks where you want the agent to think, not just execute

## Building Proactive Agents

To build proactive agents, you need:

1. **Clear objectives**: What should the agent optimize for?
2. **Data access**: What information can the agent monitor?
3. **Approval workflows**: How do you review and approve proposals?
4. **Execution capabilities**: What can the agent do after approval?

Our [Agent Fabric](/projects/the-agent-fabric) provides the infrastructure layer for deploying proactive agents at scale.

## The Hybrid Approach

Most successful systems use both:

- **Reactive agents** handle routine operations
- **Proactive agents** identify opportunities and propose improvements
- **You** review proactive proposals and approve the best ones

This creates a flywheel: reactive agents execute, proactive agents improve, you make strategic decisions.

## Common Mistakes

**Mistake 1**: Trying to make reactive agents proactive
- You can't add "thinking" to a workflow tool
- Proactive agents require different architecture

**Mistake 2**: Building proactive agents without approval workflows
- Proactive agents need human oversight
- Approval workflows prevent bad decisions

**Mistake 3**: Expecting proactive agents to be perfect
- They'll propose things you reject—that's the point
- The value is in the thinking, not perfect execution

## Getting Started

Start with one proactive agent:

1. Pick a domain you want monitored (market, competitors, your own metrics)
2. Define what "opportunity" looks like
3. Set up approval workflow (email, Slack, dashboard)
4. Start with narrow scope, expand as you learn
